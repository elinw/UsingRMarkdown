- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson you will learn to use RMarkdown.
   Using RMarkdown to create documents and notebooks
   is an important part of the reproducible research
   workflow.

   In particular we will be using RMarkdown in RStudio.



- Class: text
  Output: Markdown is system for creating text documents that is
    simple to use but still lets you use basic formatting
     like bold face, italics and lists. It is similar to
     writing in many email systems.  You may have used
     markdown without knowing it when writing comments on
     the Web. Markdown is especially useful for writing
     things that will be read on the Web.

    RMarkdown is a special version (sometimes called a
     flavor) of markdown used for R. Markdown has different
     flavors because people have added useful features
     for different situations. For example, Github has its
     own flavor of markdown.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The first step in learning rmarkown is to create an
     empty file with the extension "rmd" (notice that is
     short for rmarkdown). The extension is the part of
     the name of a file that comes after a "." (a period
     or dot).
      This extension lets RStudio know
     that it contains markdown and is not another format
     of file such as PDF (which has the pdf extension) or Word
     (which usually has the docx extension).


      We'll call the first markdown file "my_markdown_1.rmd".
      Notice that there are no spaces in the name;
      we're using underscores instead of spaces.  This will
      reduce the chances of problems later.


      ***Important! If you already hae a file called my_markdown_1.rmd delete it now!***


      To create the file type this exact command at the > prompt


      file.edit('my_markdown_1.rmd')

      double check what you typed and hit enter.
  CorrectAnswer: file.edit('my_markdown_1.rmd')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="file.edit('my_markdown_1.rmd')")
  Hint: Type the code exactly file.edit('my_markdown_1.rmd'). Make sure you have the quotation marks.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Look at the tab on the top of the file. What does the text on the tab say?
  AnswerChoices: my_markdown_1;my_file.rmd;my_markdown_1.rmd
  CorrectAnswer: my_markdown_1.rmd
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='my_markdown_1.rmd')
  Hint: Copy the text exactly.

- Class: mult_question

- Class: text
  Output: So far you have a very simple document, with just your name.
    Before we do anything fancier, let's learn how to output
    the file into different formats.  As usual in R there are
    several different ways of doing this.
