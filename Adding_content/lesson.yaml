- Class: text
  Output: Now that you know how to create a RMarkdown file and knit it
     to various formats, let's add some content to the
     document.

     If you don't have my_markdown_1.rmd open in your editor
     open it now by clicking on it in your file list.

      When doing this lesson you will sometimes see "tick marks" that look like "`".
      Do not type these ... they are needed to let Swirl run.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: For our example, let's make an autobiography.

   We will start by creating an outline of headings and
   subheadings.  In markdown these are indicated by a `#`
   on the left side.  Now turn the line with your name on it
   into the main heading.  Put a "#" before your name. It should
   look like this

   `# Name`

   Knit the file.

   How does the knitted file compare to the previous version?
  AnswerChoices: It is the same;The text is in italics;The text is bigger and bolder
  CorrectAnswer: The text is bigger and bolder
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The text is bigger and bolder')
  Hint: Make sure you added the "#"" and knitted the document.
        Don't forget to not include the back ticks!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Does the "#" show in your knitted document?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: Look at your knitted document and see if there is a "#".
        If there is one, check your document knit again.

- Class: text
  Output: The "#" does not show because it is "mark up" meaning it
     is giving instructions to Knit about how to
     format the document.  A single "#"" says that what
     follows is Header level 1 or H1.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now  let's add subheadings call H2 or Header level 2.
      You do this by putting two hash tags `##`.
      Add

      `## Early years`

      and then two more subheadings`:` Life before College
      and College Days

     Knit your document.  How does the text in the level 2
     headings compare to the text in level 1?

  AnswerChoices: Exactly the same; Slightly smaller; Slightly larger; Not sure
  CorrectAnswer: Slightly smaller
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Slightly smaller')
  Hint: Look at the file closely. Also if you are not sure,
        try knitting to another format.
        Don't forget to not include the back ticks!


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Do you see the `##` once you have knitted?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;Not sure
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: If you do see "##"check your file, make sure the line starts with "##".
     You can also try adding a blank line before your H2 line and put a space after "##".

- Class: text
  Output: The "##" go away when you knit because they are markup characters and tell
     Knitr how to format the text that follows.

     The text looks slightly different because of some hidden
     instructions that say how to format each level.  When you learn more
     you can learn how to modify these to do things like change fonts,
     font sizes or colors.


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now let's follow the same logic and add H3 using "###".
    Underneath the College Days put "### Lehman College"
    and additional "###" headings for each other college
    you have attended (if any).

    Knit your file, trying at least two formats (such as
    PDF, HTML and Word).

    How do the H3 headings compare to the H2 headings?
  AnswerChoices: The same;Smaller;Larger;Not sure
  CorrectAnswer: Smaller
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Smaller')
  Hint: Check the different formats if you can't see difference.
     If the headings are not showing as headings, make sure they
     are on  new lines and consider adding spaces above
     and below the heading lines.
     Make sure to not include the "" marks.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Look at the top of your markdown file.  What happens in the file when you
     knit to different formats (PDF, HTML, Word)?
  AnswerChoices: Nothing.;The order of the document types changes.;The color of the text changes.
  CorrectAnswer: The order of the document types changes.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='The order of the document types changes.')
  Hint: Try knitting to each format and look back at your markdown file after each know.


- Class: text
  Output: Now let's add some text to the document.
         Always put a blank line between what you type and the next header.
         Under the main heading (with your name) add a sentence
         saying something about yourself.
         Under the Early Years add a sentence about you when you
         were under age 12.
         Under Life Before College add a sentence about what your life
         from age 13 until you started college.
         Under College Days add a sentence about your life while you have been
         in college.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Knit your document to the format of your choice. How does the
        text you added look?
  AnswerChoices: Like regular text;Like text but the headers are messed up;Like a header.
  CorrectAnswer: Like regular text
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Like regular text')
  Hint: If it doesn't look like regular text, check to make sure that
     you have a blank line before each header line.
     Make sure you didn't accidently modify your header lines.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's make the first sentence of your document italics.
     Do this by putting `_` before and after the sentence.
     This is called an underscore.  You will find the key to the
     right of the 0 on the keyboard, use the shift key.
     Knit your document.  Is the sentence italics?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;Not sure
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: Make sure you have put _ before and after the text.
     For example`:`

     _I was born in the Bronx_

     Italics makes the text look slanted.
     Do not include the tick marks.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's make a word bold face.  To do this put `**` before
      and after the word.

      Knit your document.  What does the word look like?
  AnswerChoices: Darker;Lighter;The same; Not sure
  CorrectAnswer: Darker
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Darker')
  Hint: The boldface should make your word look darker.
     Your word should look like

     **School**
    Make sure to not include the "" marks.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Next let's make a numbered list.

   Under Life Before College put schools you attended
   with one school per line.

   At the beginnning of each lie put a number followed by
   a period (`.`).  So 1., 2., 3. and so on.

   Make sure to have a space between the `.` and the text.

   Put a blank line after the last item in the list.

   Knit your document. What does it look like?
  AnswerChoices: A nicely formatted list with all the number aligned underneath each other; Something else.
  CorrectAnswer: A nicely formatted list with all the number aligned underneath each other
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A nicely formatted list with all the number aligned underneath each other')
  Hint: Make sure that each number has a period (`.`) after it.
      Make sure you are starting each newnumber on an new
      line.
      Make sure you have a blank line after the last item.
      Make sure to not include the tick marks.

- Class: text
  Output:
      If you have problems with lists it will almost
      always be dur to missing spaces or blank lines.
      Sometimes you will also need to put two blank spaces
      at the end of each item on your list.



- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now let's add an unnumbered list also called a bulleted list.
     Under Life before College

     Put `*` followed by a space and then the name of a family member or friend.

     Repeat this for several names.

     Knit your document.  How does the list of names look?
  AnswerChoices: Like a list of names with 'bullets' next to each item.;Not like a list.
  CorrectAnswer: Like a list of names with 'bullets' next to each item.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Like a list of names with 'bullets' next to each item.")
  Hint: Make sure that you have a space between the * and the name.
        Have only one name per line.
        Leave a blank line after the end of the list.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: We've mentioned before that it is possible to make your
     output look very different. As our last step
     let's try that.  Directly underneath     output`:`
     and above the first output option as of now put

     put

     tufte::tufte_html`:` default  without the quotation marks in the middle!!! And exactly 1 space
     after the colon.

     and knit.

     What happened to your document?
  AnswerChoices: Whoa it looks really different.;It looks the same.;I got an error message.
  CorrectAnswer: Whoa it looks really different.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Whoa it looks really different.')
  Hint: Make sure that you typed the letters exactly including the
     double colon between tufte and tufte_html and the single
     colon after html, followed by a space and the word default.
     Make sure the names for the different document formats
     lineup on the left.


- Class: text
  Output: There are many more aspects of formatting RMarkdown documents
     that we can learn, but now you have some basic tools.  In
     the RStudio Help menu you will find some links to RMarkdown
     resources.  There are also many resources on the Web.

     Now let's continue to lesson three, where we add code.
